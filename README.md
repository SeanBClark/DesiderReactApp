# DesiderReactApp

Front End example of https://www.desider.org

The idea for desider came about after unsucessful attemps to get my partner to make a decision on what to eat for dinner. So I made them a basic appliaction that found restaurants that are nearby to her. This then expaned into recipes. It was then that I desided to make desider. As it stands it can find restaurants to eat at, recipes to cook, books to read and movies to watch. 

All pages render for both desktop and mobile devices. 

API keys are hidden, if you wish to use this example you will have to get API keys for various APIs including Google, Spoonacular, TheMoiveDB as well as any others.

Backend is built using python django, however this example is detached and works on its own.
